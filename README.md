# Hello world!

A *long* time ago I created this website to house my digital portfolio.

I have since moved my [portfolio over to Webflow](https://saracagle.webflow.io/), yet this Github site still remains! I've migrated a couple things back to this site, but have taken offline my projects and experience page for now.

As such, I will be using it for my HCDE 533 class. You may find remnants of styling or content in the live site. Thanks for your understanding.

Also, my Github seems to be acting funky? My commits say they're coming from my account but they're not tying into my account? (As the professor and TA,) let me know if you have any concerns and I can show you that I am me. 

Thanks!
