<h1>About</h1>
<div class="boxOfText">
<p>I'm a 4th year computer science and Mandarin Chinese language and culture double major at Georgia Tech, graduating in December 2016. My interests vary from UI/UX and web development to databases and network security. My Georgia Tech CS threads are People (HCI) and Info-Internetworks.</p>
<p>I speak Mandarin Chinese and can read/write simplified characters. I have a strong interest in cross-cultural communication, knowledge, and development.</p>

<p><b>Why computer science?</b>
	I love the Internet! As a user experiencing website trends over time, I found myself questioning various design choices, wanting to help change and improve the browsing experience. As a developer, I'd like to address these design choices and how to incorporate them better across different platforms and mediums to reach a more global audience.

<p><b>Why Chinese?</b>
	I began studying Mandarin in 2008 and quickly fell in love with the language, the culture, the people, and the sheer ability of technology to cater to a population of 1.4 billion people and growing.<br />
	I can read, speak, and write (simplified characters), and have spent significant time abroad: most recently, a year directly enrolled in Beijing's Peking University as a Chinese as a Second Language student.
	My experiences have shown me that no matter how well you understand something, you probably don't understand it completely, because you do not view it through the eyes of someone else's culture. <br />

	<b>Thoughts on Chinese Culture</b><br />
	Chinese and American cultures are extremely different, and that's wonderful! The key is being able to understand which differences stem from cultural differences versus which differences stem simply from communication. During my time in China, I've encountered and learned from a number of scenarios trying to navigate the cultural divide, giving me an insight into how Chinese culture influences everything from daily routines to the way in which apps are developed.<br />
	More so, what my experience has taught me is that no two cultures, and by extension people, are the same, meaning that despite the Internet being a global phenomenon, <i>we are each experiencing it diferrently.</i><br />
	I believe the Internet will grow and is growing to accomodate these different global viewpoints, and I want to use my cross-cultural knowledge to help with its development.

<p><b>Currently</b>
	I am very excited to be graduating in December 2016! I am seeking a <i>full-time role</i> in a  globally-focused work place where I can use my Chinese language skills and cultural knowledge. I am most interested in (technical) product/project management roles and software development roles.<br />
	I excel in front-end development and design, but my previous experience and classwork ranges from Python to Java to C to databases and security, leaving me open-minded to other opportunities.

<div class="groupedText">
<p><b>Long Term</b>
	 My goal is to one day work for an American company with Chinese offices and act as a cultural-bridge in product development as a <i>developer</i> or <i>project manager</i>. I'm also interested in fulfilling the same role for a Chinese company looking to expand into the international market. I am very open to moving abroad.
