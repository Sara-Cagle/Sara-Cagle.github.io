        <b>Designing Boxes with Grasshopper the Hard Way</b>
        Why do something the easy way when you can over engineer it the hard way? I attended class remotely this week
        and did not have a chance to gauge the scale of the material and machinery I would be working with until I went
        to the makerspace. As a result, I did not want to <i>box</i> (haha, get it?) myself into a specific sized box or
        design. I felt Grasshopper would be a great way to address this problem so that once I have my material picked
        out, I can create a box of any size.
    </p>
    <p>
        I first started with a square for which I could toggle the width/height. This square would be a face for which I
        would cut 6 of to make a cube. I then created rectangular "slots" with a toggleable width (the depth of the
        material) and height that
        I would use for the interlocking pieces of the box.<br />
        Rather than designate how many slots I wanted on each side of the square, I decided it would be better for the
        number of slots to be auto-determined by the space I wanted between each slot. I drafted a rough equation for
        how I would calculate that.<br />
        <i>b</i> = desired space between slots<br />
        <i>w</i> = square width<br />
        <i>G</i> = Height of slot + <i>b</i><br />
        <i>N</i> = Number of slots = Floor(<i>w</i>/ <i>G</i>)<br />
        This calculates the total number of possible slots and their space between for the given square size. Because we
        calculate the slot size and their space between, we must subtract one of the spaces "between" since there will
        be a slot at the end that is not followed by another slot.<br /><br />
        I then needed to calculate the distance between the corner of the square and the slots, which I did with<br />
        Distance from corner to first slot = (<i>w</i>-(<i>N*</i><i>G</i>- <i>b</i>))/2<br />
        <br />
        Because I was planning on making the slots symmetrical on the edge, I would divide the remaining space not taken
        up by the slots by 2.
    </p>
    <p>
        After coming up with this equation, I moved the first slot on a side into its desired location and then used a
        linear array with the count of <i>N</i> and the distance of <i>G</i> to programatically create the slots down
        the side.
    </p>
    <p>
        I then moved the slots across the square by shifting by <i>w</i> and then rotated and moved them again, finally
        each side of the square had slots.
    </p>
    <p>
        The dogbones were much more challenging since they had to be manipulated seperately from the slots sinc they
        were only needed on inner corners. I followed roughly the same placement approach as the slots, except I did so
        with 2 small circles, for which the radius can be toggled.
    </p>
    <p>
        With all the pieces in place, I was then stuck in "Trim" Hell. Very fitting for the spooky season. It took
        several approaches to trimming regions and rejoining to end with all the required lines.<br />
        I trimmed the "cut in" slots and the "cut out" slots from the square seperately, which ended up with curves that
        overlapped eachother. I then had to "explode" the curves and used
        <a href="https://parametricbydesign.com/grasshopper/how-tos/remove-duplicate-curves/">this tutorial</a>
        on finding duplicate line segments so I could remove the dupes. On top of that, the segments needed to be
        appropriately flattened before they could be marked as dupes--something I debugged all by myself!<br />
        Finally I trimmed the dogbones out using that new joined curve of the slotted square.<br />
        I think of everything, this part can be simplified somehow.<br />
        Green indicates inputs, yellow indicates annotations, blue indicates slots/tabs, and pink indicates dogbones.

        <b>KiCAD</b>
        To mill, I needed to export my Rhino files into DXF files of the cutting path and engraving paths. I then
        imported these paths into KiCAD as User.Drawings (engravings) and Edge.Cuts (cutting paths). KiCAD could then
        plot my files into Gerber files that the Bantam mill would understand as machine code. I had to take care to
        ensure I was importing/exporting the correct layers so the machine would cut and engrave properly, something I
        had trouble with that I'll share below.

        <b>Milling with Bantam</b>
        After procuring the Gerber files, I brought them into Bantam.<br />
        I first opened the User Drawing file as the top layer and then loaded in the Edge Cuts file as the outline. This
        part led to a lot of drama that you can read below.<br />
        Following this, I then ensured I was using a 1/32" flat end mill tool.<br />
        In the material set up, I input the width, height, and depth of the material I'd be milling through
        (100x70x1.4mm). I then stuck two FR1 boards together and measured the difference of their combined thickness to
        the single board to find the Z-offset for the material. I try to minimize offsetting the material X and Y to
        save material and instead place the board as close to the edge of the platform as possible<br />
        However, I <i>do</i> set a minor plan offset of 2x2x0mm as a sanity check that the mill won't run off the edge
        of the material.<br />
        Finally, since we are working with only our single mill tool, I ignore the warning that says marked areas need a
        smaller tool and go to mill!

    <p>
        In the mill, I sandwich 2 pieces of FR1 with double sided tape, so that if the tool goes completely through my
        top later, it won't hurt the platform and instead hit my second piece of material. I then stick the material to
        the platform with more double sided tape. I did not have any issues with my pieces coming up because I used a
        <i>lot</i> of tape.

    <p>
        Milling designs with lots of engravings slows down the machine and creates a lot of extra dust, but as long as
        everything is aligned right, the process completes without issue.

        <b>Final Design</b>
        20mm by 20mm cube fit together by roughly 4mm slots and tabs. Parametric circles dot each side. The sides fit
        together snuggly in most places but variations in the material seems to make them sit slightly askew in spots.
