        <b>Designing Boxes with Grasshopper the Hard Way</b>
        Why do something the easy way when you can over engineer it the hard way? I attended class remotely this week
        and did not have a chance to gauge the scale of the material and machinery I would be working with until I went
        to the makerspace. As a result, I did not want to <i>box</i> (haha, get it?) myself into a specific sized box or
        design. I felt Grasshopper would be a great way to address this problem so that once I have my material picked
        out, I can create a box of any size.
    </p>
    <p>
        I first started with a square for which I could toggle the width/height. This square would be a face for which I
        would cut 6 of to make a cube. I then created rectangular "slots" with a toggleable width (the depth of the
        material) and height that
        I would use for the interlocking pieces of the box.<br />
        Rather than designate how many slots I wanted on each side of the square, I decided it would be better for the
        number of slots to be auto-determined by the space I wanted between each slot. I drafted a rough equation for
        how I would calculate that.<br />
        <i>b</i> = desired space between slots<br />
        <i>w</i> = square width<br />
        <i>G</i> = Height of slot + <i>b</i><br />
        <i>N</i> = Number of slots = Floor(<i>w</i>/ <i>G</i>)<br />
        This calculates the total number of possible slots and their space between for the given square size. Because we
        calculate the slot size and their space between, we must subtract one of the spaces "between" since there will
        be a slot at the end that is not followed by another slot.<br /><br />
        I then needed to calculate the distance between the corner of the square and the slots, which I did with<br />
        Distance from corner to first slot = (<i>w</i>-(<i>N*</i><i>G</i>- <i>b</i>))/2<br />
        <br />
        Because I was planning on making the slots symmetrical on the edge, I would divide the remaining space not taken
        up by the slots by 2.
    </p>
    <p>
        After coming up with this equation, I moved the first slot on a side into its desired location and then used a
        linear array with the count of <i>N</i> and the distance of <i>G</i> to programatically create the slots down
        the side.
    </p>
    <p>
        I then moved the slots across the square by shifting by <i>w</i> and then rotated and moved them again, finally
        each side of the square had slots.
    </p>
    <p>
        The dogbones were much more challenging since they had to be manipulated seperately from the slots sinc they
        were only needed on inner corners. I followed roughly the same placement approach as the slots, except I did so
        with 2 small circles, for which the radius can be toggled.
    </p>
    <p>
        With all the pieces in place, I was then stuck in "Trim" Hell. Very fitting for the spooky season. It took
        several approaches to trimming regions and rejoining to end with all the required lines.<br />
        I trimmed the "cut in" slots and the "cut out" slots from the square seperately, which ended up with curves that
        overlapped eachother. I then had to "explode" the curves and used
        <a href="https://parametricbydesign.com/grasshopper/how-tos/remove-duplicate-curves/">this tutorial</a>
        on finding duplicate line segments so I could remove the dupes. On top of that, the segments needed to be
        appropriately flattened before they could be marked as dupes--something I debugged all by myself!<br />
        Finally I trimmed the dogbones out using that new joined curve of the slotted square.<br />
        I think of everything, this part can be simplified somehow.<br />
        Green indicates inputs, yellow indicates annotations, blue indicates slots/tabs, and pink indicates dogbones.

        <b>Milling with Bantam</b>
        To mill, I needed to export my Rhino files into DXF files of the cutting path and engraving paths. I then
        imported these paths into KiCAD as User.Drawings (engravings) and Edge.Cuts (cutting paths). KiCAD could then
        plot my files into Gerber files that the Bantam mill would understand as machine code. I had to take care to
        ensure I was importing/exporting the correct layers so the machine would cut and engrave properly, something I
        had trouble with that I'll share below.

        I moved on to cylinders and completely misunderstood the "Tube" command on Rhino as I struggled to make
        concentric circles and then cap them the right way. After a couple of attempts, I spoke to my classmate Minah
        Kim Bass about her print tests and she introduced me to the "Tube" command. Better late than never!<br />
        I wasn't sure what size cylinders to test, so Junchao recommended I try creating cylinders with walls of 0.4mm
        and 0.8mm width, which became my standard for various print tests.

    <p><b>Challenges With Test Printing</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>It's slow to run one print for each setting,</li>
        <li>because I had accidentally set all of my prints to run at the highest quality.</li>
        <li>
            My print walls are so thin (albeit by design), that it is challenging to find much difference between them.
        </li>
        <li>
            There's so many settings to toggle that I still don't have a good grasp of them (and I don't have enough
            time or even PLA to explore <i>everything</i>.)
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>I found that reviewing <a
            href="https://3dprinterly.com/cura-settings-ultimate-guide-settings-explained-how-to-use/">this document
            with
            indepth information on print settings from 3D Printerly</a> was more valuable to me than running and
        comparing
        test prints.

    <p><b>Nested Objects - Inspiration and Modeling in Rhino</b>
        For my nested object, I struggled to think of something to create that was both interesting, simple, and not a
        copy of someone else's work. My brain struggles to understand how these nested items can be designed and printed
        together. I hunted around Thingiverse and looked at some <a
            href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:167120">nested armour pieces</a> and recalled a video I saw some
        weeks ago about a collapsable light saber. Minah showed me screenshots of her polagonal nested piece of art. But
        none of these ideas sounded like <i>me.</i><br />
        I finally turned to my boyfriend, who has built a car in his free time and owns his own 3D printer, to ask about
        nested things I could
        print. He listed off various mechanical items that were of no real interest to me, until he announced: "build
        one of your plant stands with the wheels."<br />
        That was it! I will build a mini plantstand with wheels. A table-top creation for some little teacup plants, not
        my monster 100 pound plants who live outside.<br />
        ...but maybe I should just start with the wheels, first.
    </p>
    <p>
        So I took a look at a plant stand I have from Daiso with my calipers to get a rough idea of wheel measurements.
        I wanted to create a wheel that had:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>3 rolling "wheel" pieces,</li>
        <li>an axel for the "wheels" to roll freely around,</li>
        <li>and static spacers attached to the axel between each "wheel" and one on each end.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This wheel would allow for movement of the wheel while maintaining a static axel, with the hope that a further
        piece could be designed to fit around the axel to both protect the wheels from flipping, and also enable the
        wheel to be mounted to a solid object, whether it be a piece of wood or something else 3D printed.
    </p>
    <div class="centerFlexImages">
        <img src="/images/hcde533/a3/plant stand.JPG" class="projectImage"
            alt="A large white diagram showing Grasshopper components, color coded with which items are inputs." />
    </div>
    <span class="centerCaption">Plant stand from Daiso, upside down to view the wheels.</span>
    <p>
        I started by listing out the pieces I would need: 3 tubes to become wheels, 4 small cylinders to become the
        static spacers, and 1 long cylinder to be the axel. I based their measurements on my existing plant stand wheels
        with some rounding for easier math.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Wheels: 30mm outer diameter, 8mm inner diameter, 5mm depth</li>
        <li>Spacers: 10mm diameter (must be larger than 8mm so they hold the wheels apart), 3mm depth</li>
        <li>Axel: 5mm diameter (smaller than the wheel diameter to allow for it to roll), 30mm depth (length),
            calculated by summing the necessary widths as well as adding some wiggle room for the wheels.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Build Process</b>
    <ol>
        <li>After creating these pieces, I attached the end caps to the axel by moving the objects to eachother using
            object snap.
        </li>
        <li>I then used "Align" to align them concentrically (one of those trig words I learned from A2!)</li>
        <li>I then used the "Align" tool again to align the 3 wheels and 2 other spacers. </li>
        <li>Once concentrically around the axel, I
            spaced them out in the right order (end cap, wheel, spacer, wheel, spacer, wheel, end cap) and used the
            "Distribute" tool in the Z-plane to have all of the pieces space themselves out. Align and distribute are my
            favorite Powerpoint features, so using them was second nature.
        </li>
        <li>Finally I needed to join the static pieces into a single object rather
            than multiple intersecting objects. <a href="https://youtu.be/KAnQ31657dg">This video on merging faces</a>
            showed me to use the "Boolean Union" tool to bring the objects together.

        <li>Finally, I grouped the wheel as a single entity so I wouldn't accidentally drag it apart.</li>
        <li>I built it in the Z-plane like a sandwich, but knew I needed to rotate it 90 degrees so it was laying
            sideways to limit the overhangs I would end up printing.

    <p><b>Printing the Wheel</b>
        The biggest challenge was figuring out how to print the wheel to limit overhangs. Overhangs wasted PLA by
        requiring support structures which would need to be broken off after. There are multiple settings to toggle that
        can limit PLA usage and ease the "breaking off" process at the end of the print, yet a preview in Cura can only
        show so much
    </p>
    <p>First iteration preview of the wheel: Standard quality, 0.8mm wall thickness, wall line
        count of 2, supports everywhere, support pattern of lines and density of 8% for easier breakage.<br />

        At some point near the mid-early stage of the print, a failure occurred and pulled away part of the wheel. The
        wheel that remained was mostly satisfactory, so I toggled the settings a bit for the next try.<br />
        However, I did find that the support structures were very challenging to break off for the successful part of
        the print. After finally breaking off the supports, the single successful part of the print did spin like a
        wheel!</p>

    <p>Second iteration preview of the wheel: Standard quality, 0.8mm wall thickness, wall line
        count of 2, supports everywhere, support pattern of lines and density of 8% for easier breakage (all the same as
        above). Turn on
        spiralize contour for smoothness. Increased density from 10% to 20% to try and slow the nozzle to the wheel as
        it moves. Change infill pattern from Lines to Concentric.<br />
        The print did not fall apart in the printer this time! But even with increased density, the spiralized seemed to
        weaken the object while creating extra supports. However, the supports at the bottom of the wheel where it
        touched the bed remained very challenging to break off without breaking the wheel (as I ended up doing.)<br />
        I think I should stick closer to the first print settings and maybe change the base from a skirt to a raft so
        the pieces don't get ripped up and away.</p>

    <p>Following this, I made some changes to the model to make the wheels slightly thicker, the spacers slightly
        smaller, and the axel shorter as well. If I ever wanted this to help support something, it would need to be more
        condensed. I also opted to try some new support settings.</p>
    <p>Super quality, 0.12mm wall thickness, wall line count of 3, supports everywhere using a raft and tree structure,
        support pattern of lines and density of 8%. Infill density of 20%, top/bottom pattern of concentric.</p>
