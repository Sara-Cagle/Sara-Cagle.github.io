    <p><b>Sleeves - Designing Parametrically with Grasshopper and Rhino</b> I used Grasshopper to parametrically create
        the
        elliptical patterns for each sleeve. I used the "InEllipse" component that creates an ellipse out of 3 points. I
        then generated a toggleable amount of points around the X axis using then "expression" component that would then
        be used to create my ellipses. I scaled the ellipses and offset the result to create a shape (rather than a
        single line) that could be cut with the laser. From there, I baked the geometry into Rhino.<br />
        <br />
        In Rhino, i played around with different trimming styles to design the type of shape I wanted. Because all the
        ellipses were overlapping on one side, their segments needed to be trimmed out to create a coherent shape. I
        tested out two different cut styles: one with the ellipses cut without any overlapping segments such that the
        result would be flat, and another where the line segments extended beyond the cut ellipse, causing the ellipses
        to be more layered. The second approach better fit my design. I also used Rhino to create the buffer zones on
        the ellipses to allow room for the sleeves to be sewn to the printed neckpiece.<br /><br />
        Finally, I needed the design for the inner mesh for each sleeve. I broke the geometry into each ellipse and then
        used "TweenCurves" to get a middle curve to work with. I would use these middle curves directly for cutting the
        mesh.

    <p><b>Sleeves - Laser Cutting with the Epilog</b> I cut several layers of fabric in the size of the laser bed and
        then headed to Microsoft's makerspace, The Garage. <br />
        I first used large sheets of butcher paper cut to the size of the laser bed to practice cutting the sleeve
        shapes. This was how I was able to gauge the length I wanted, the number of ellipses I wanted, as well as the
        cut style previously mentioned.

    <br />
    <br />
    In Rhino, I prepared my cuts by drawing a 24x18in rectangle on a different layer and locking the layer. This
    would be the laser bed that I needed to fit within or splice between. Luckily I was able to fit individual cuts
    into a single copy of the bed--no splicing across cuts. I also used these bed outlines for exporting my
    geometries, particularly the mesh pieces, for which I needed to cut 20 total.<br /><br />
    After paper prototyping and determining sizing, I tested with some scrap black cotton I had to fiddle with laser
    settings. The cotton sliced perfectly. Then I was able to move to my specific sleeve fabric, which also cut
    without any issues.

    <br /><br />
    However, the mesh tulle was much more challenging. I was prepared for issues of the mesh flying around due to
    the ventilation fan, so I used painters tape to tape across the material. This held the fabric down, but the
    laser was too strong and ended up singeing the edges, ruining the shapes. I noticed that the areas taped however
    had a nice crisp edge. To fix the issue, I decided that since I would be taping the fabric anyways to weigh it
    down, I would just mask the entire sheets with painters tape, which worked well enough. I tried some other
    techniques along the way of sandwiching with butcher paper, but edges still ended up being singed.

    <p><b>The Neckpiece - 3D Printing & Stock Parts</b> I originally intended for the collar of the garment to be a
        so I tried breaking the design into 4 pieces that would fit together with 3/4in width strap. I had also
        purchased LED lights for the far-reaching Phase 4 of my project. I used my calipers to measure the width of LED
        strand such that it would fit within my collar print. My measurements worked like a charm.
    <div class="centerFlexImages">
        <img src="/images/hcde533/a8/collar0.jpg" />
        <img src="/images/hcde533/a8/collar1.jpg" />
        <img src="/images/hcde533/a8/collar2.jpg" />
    </div>
    <span class="centerCaption">Three different collar iterations, two of them designed to slide the LED strip into the
        gap</span>
    <br /><br />

    However, despite a handful of iterations on the collar shape, the design was functional but not pleasing to the
    eye. Since I was behind schedule and not planning on hitting Phase 4, I took a different route and removed the
    LED stock parts, despite their perfect fit. Instead, I moved on to my other idea: 3D printing a neckpiece design
    on black tulle. This would serve almost the exact same function as the original design. I needed something to
    wrap around my shoulders and allow the sleeves
    to be connected to it.<br /><br />

    I began experimenting printing rectangles on different pieces of fabric. Using Cura, I was able to set a
    post-processing script that allowed me to pause the GCode print at either a specific layer or a height so I
    could insert a piece of fabric. Since I was experimenting with different shapes and sizes, I opted for the layer
    choice. Pausing at layer 3 to 5 appeared to be ideal. I also found that printed designs were best flexible and
    visually appealing with a gap of about 0.8 to 1.5mm between each shape. Any smaller and it couldn't move well,
    and any larger it was not coherent.<br /><br />
    I practices printing with a thicker, wide-holed mesh as well as my tulle and both worked fine. Attaching the
    fabric to the printer was the most challenging part. I originally tried tape but the heated bed weakens the
    glue. Using binder clips to secure a large cut of fabric over the board worked the best, as long as you handled
    the clips with care (while adding or removing a clip, the bed is prone to slipping and will throw off the print
    layers). Unfortunately this means wasting more fabric than desired, since the fabric needs to stretch all the
    way across the bed but not all of it will be printed on.
    </p>

    <p><b>The Neckpiece - Rhino and Grasshopper (Again)</b> To design the "scales" for 3D printing on fabric, I used
        Grasshopper to generate grids of different sized rectangles. After baking a design I liked, I would use the
        Rhino scale function to achieve different measurements (like the previously mentioned 1.5mm gap.) <br /><br />
        For the piece that would wrap around my shoulder, I knew I'd need different shapes to flow in different ways to
        capture the curve of a shoulder. I first made a rough pattern of my shoulder by covering my shoulder and top of
        arm with masking tape. I then directed my boyfriend to draw guidelines on it, such as a line across the top for
        the flat part and a curve around the round part of the shoulder. I then took it off and measured those pieces
        flat to know which sizes I should target.<br /><br />
        Back in Grasshopper, I knew I wanted something radial, so I created a circle and tried to draw various polygons
        within it to get the look I wanted. I finally ended up using the 2D "Radial" grid component with the circle and
        then building off the cells and points. This was the only way I was able to generate "rectangles" that were
        relatively sized around the circle without writing an expression. Using the "Distance" and "Larger Than"
        components, I was able to scale the rectangles to be larger the further away they are from the center of the
        circle. I baked the results into Rhino and did some refining to remove overlaps, straighten some lines, remove
        some pieces, and scale in different factors as I tested the print.<br /><br />
        Closing in on the final, I decided I did not like the flat surface I was printing. I drew some curves and lofted
        them onto my print designs, both the rectangles and the radial grid. The curves added a nice dimension that was
        originally missing.<br /><br />
        When creating the design that would replace the front part of the collar, I tried reusing the shoulder radial
        pieces, but the scale looked poor. Instead, I drew some circles and then scaled them to a shape based on my
        measurements. I then took a collection of my original rectangle pieces and used "Flow" to move them along the
        curve--I wish I had explored this option sooner! This front piece would be split into 3 pieces for printing, and
        then the back piece would be split into 2 down the middle. I finally had completed the design!

    <p><b>Putting it All Together - Sewing & Post Processing</b> Taking on a fabric-based project always means sewing.
        After my 3D prints on tulle had completed, I trimmed one edge at a time and then hand-sewed them
        together.<br /><br />
        However, the hardest part was attaching the tulle to the elliptical layers on the sleeves. Because I laser cut
        20 pieces individually to size, I needed to attach each piece perfectly. I placed the black cut sleeve fabric on
        cardboard and stretched the ellipses out, pinning each to hold it firm. I then used Gorilla Spray Adhesive to
        spray it, and added each layer one-by-one, starting with the smallest and stacking on top. This built the
        sleeves from the inside out, and they would be flipped over when worn. The adhesive was messy and not always
        strong enough, and I went over layers multiple times and tried re-pinning layers to encourage them to dry
        together. The tulle was so exact that it was hard to place perfectly. Were I to do this again, I would cut the
        tulle larger than needed, glue, and then go back and remove the excess by hand. In a perfect world, this
        attachment would be done by sewing machine, yet the laser allowed me to cut indescribably thin pieces of fabric
        that would get caught up in my machine.

    After drying, the sleeves were hand-sewn to the shoulder pieces. The shoulder pieces were hand-sewn to the front
    and back collar pieces, and a small hook was hand sewn to the collar on the back to keep it closed.

        <b>Challenges</b>
    <ul>
        I got really sick. A large chunk of this project period I was unable to function, which set me back several
        days. Ultimately I only completed Phase 1 of my project, but it was beyond my control.
    </ul>
    <ul>
        3D printing requires planning time, but also contingency planning time. I planned out my print time for my
        designs, but I did not factor in failure and time to re-print my designs after my testing phase.
    </ul>
    <ul>
        Exploring in Grasshopper is harder than it looks. Over the past 10 weeks I've been watching Grasshopper
        tutorials to fall asleep at night. I've learned so much, but when starting my own design from scratch, it's
        challenging to find the tools you want. Grasshopper components don't work the way I think traditionally or even
        as a programmer, so I spend a lot of time looking in the wrong place or trying poor methods to achieve
        something.
