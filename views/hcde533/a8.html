    <p><b>Sleeves - Designing Parametrically with Grasshopper and Rhino</b> I used Grasshopper to parametrically create
        the elliptical patterns for each sleeve. I used the "InEllipse" component that creates an ellipse out of 3
        points. I then generated a toggleable amount of points around the X axis using then "expression" component that
        would then be used to create my ellipses. I scaled the ellipses and offset the result to create a shape (rather
        than a single line) that could be cut with the laser. From there, I baked the geometry into Rhino.

    <span class="centerCaption">Ellipses baked into different layers to better evaluate where to trim</span>

    <br />
    <br />

    In Rhino, I played around with different trimming styles to design the type of shape I wanted. Because all the
    ellipses were overlapping on one side, their segments needed to be trimmed out to create a coherent shape. I
    tested out two different cut styles: one with the ellipses cut without any overlapping segments such that the
    result would be flat, and another where the line segments extended beyond the cut ellipse, causing the ellipses
    to be more layered. The second approach better fit my design. I also used Rhino to create the buffer zones on
    the ellipses to allow room for the sleeves to be sewn to the printed neckpiece.

    <span class="centerCaption">Ellipses baked into different layers to better evaluate where to trim.</span>
    <br /><br />
    Finally, I needed the design for the inner mesh for each sleeve. I broke the geometry into each ellipse and then
    used "TweenCurves" to get a middle curve to work with. I would use these middle curves directly for cutting the
    mesh.

    <p><b>Sleeves - Laser Cutting with the Epilog</b> I cut several layers of fabric in the size of the laser bed and
        then headed to Microsoft's makerspace, The Garage. <br />
        I first used large sheets of butcher paper cut to the size of the laser bed to practice cutting the sleeve
        shapes. This was how I was able to gauge the length I wanted, the number of ellipses I wanted, as well as the
        cut style previously mentioned.

    <span class="centerCaption">After cutting</span>
    <br />
    <br />
    In Rhino, I prepared my cuts by drawing a 24x18in rectangle on a different layer and locking the layer. This
    would be the laser bed that I needed to fit within or splice between. Luckily I was able to fit individual cuts
    into a single copy of the bed--no splicing across cuts. I also used these bed outlines for exporting my
    geometries, particularly the mesh pieces, for which I needed to cut 20 total.

    </div>
    <span class="centerCaption">Mesh pieces ready to export</span>
    <br /><br />
    After paper prototyping and determining sizing, I tested with some scrap black cotton I had to fiddle with laser
    settings. The cotton sliced perfectly. Then I was able to move to my specific sleeve fabric, which also cut
    without any issues.
    <div class="centerFlexImages">
        <img class="projectImage" src="/images/hcde533/a8/blackfabric0.jpg" />

    <span class="centerCaption">Cotton fabric and suiting: speed 25%, power 30%</span>
    <br /><br />
    However, the mesh tulle was much more challenging. I was prepared for issues of the mesh flying around due to
    the ventilation fan, so I used painters tape to tape across the material. This held the fabric down, but the
    laser was too strong and ended up singeing the edges, ruining the shapes. I noticed that the areas taped however
    had a nice crisp edge. To fix the issue, I decided that since I would be taping the fabric anyways to weigh it
    down, I would just mask the entire sheets with painters tape, which worked well enough. I tried some other
    techniques along the way of sandwiching with butcher paper, but edges still ended up being singed.

    <p><b>The Neckpiece - 3D Printing & Stock Parts</b> I originally intended for the collar of the garment to be a
        so I tried breaking the design into 4 pieces that would fit together with 3/4in width strap. I had also
        purchased LED lights for the far-reaching Phase 4 of my project. I used my calipers to measure the width of LED
        strand such that it would fit within my collar print. My measurements worked like a charm.
    <div class="centerFlexImages">
        <img class="projectImage" src="/images/hcde533/a8/collar0.jpg" />
        <img class="projectImage" src="/images/hcde533/a8/collar1.jpg" />
        <img class="projectImage" src="/images/hcde533/a8/collar2.jpg" />
    </div>
    <span class="centerCaption">Three different collar iterations, two of them designed to slide the LED strip into the
        gap</span>
    <br /><br />

    However, despite a handful of iterations on the collar shape, the design was functional but not pleasing to the
    eye. Since I was behind schedule and not planning on hitting Phase 4, I took a different route and removed the
    LED stock parts, despite their perfect fit. Instead, I moved on to my other idea: 3D printing a neckpiece design
    on black tulle. This would serve almost the exact same function as the original design. I needed something to
    wrap around my shoulders and allow the sleeves
    to be connected to it.<br /><br />

    I began experimenting printing rectangles on different pieces of fabric. Using Cura, I was able to set a
    post-processing script that allowed me to pause the GCode print at either a specific layer or a height so I
    could insert a piece of fabric. Since I was experimenting with different shapes and sizes, I opted for the layer
    choice. Pausing at layer 3 to 5 appeared to be ideal. I also found that printed designs were best flexible and
    visually appealing with a gap of about 0.8 to 1.5mm between each shape. Any smaller and it couldn't move well,
    and any larger it was not coherent.

    <span class="centerCaption">Early stages of printing on mesh</span>

    <br /><br />
    I practiced printing with a thicker, wide-holed mesh as well as my tulle and both worked fine. Attaching the
    fabric to the printer was the most challenging part. I originally tried tape but the heated bed weakens the
    glue. Using binder clips to secure a large cut of fabric over the board worked the best, as long as you handled
    the clips with care (while adding or removing a clip, the bed is prone to slipping and will throw off the print
    layers). Unfortunately this means wasting more fabric than desired, since the fabric needs to stretch all the
    way across the bed but not all of it will be printed on.

    </div>
    <span class="centerCaption">Clamping down tulle for better layering</span>

    As I printed my pieces, I noticed that prints with small scales, such as my 3mm by 9.5mm rectangles, were
    <i>much</i> more likely to break. The bottoms of the rectangles stayed stuck to the bed while the
    scales popped off the top of the fabric. Due to lack of time to repeatedly reprint large pieces, I tried various
    post processing techniques to repair the broken scales such as using a low temp hot glue gun to
    hold the scales in place and then reattach the backs, or sewing another piece of tulle to the back to repair ripped
    mesh. Finally, I tried stopping the print twice, once at about 3 layers and again at about 6 layers,
    and placing pieces of tulle in between those layers. Then the print would have 2 pieces of fabric to provide a
    buffer from the bed in case the very bottom of the prints failed. This was successful and I used this technique for
    about half my prints.

    <p><b>The Neckpiece - Rhino and Grasshopper (Again)</b> To design the "scales" for 3D printing on fabric, I used
        Grasshopper to generate grids of different sized rectangles. After baking a design I liked, I would use the
        Rhino scale function to achieve different measurements (like the previously mentioned 1.5mm gap.)
    <div class="centerFlexImages">
        <img class="projectImage" src="/images/hcde533/a8/rectangular grid grasshopper.png" />
    </div>
    <span class="centerCaption">Grasshopper file for creating a grid of rectangles</span>
    <br /><br />
    For the piece that would wrap around my shoulder, I knew I'd need different shapes to flow in different ways to
    capture the curve of a shoulder. I first made a rough pattern of my shoulder by covering my shoulder and top of
    arm with masking tape. I then directed my boyfriend to draw guidelines on it, such as a line across the top for
    the flat part and a curve around the round part of the shoulder. I then took it off and measured those pieces
    flat to know which sizes I should target.<br /><br />
    Back in Grasshopper, I knew I wanted something radial, so I created a circle and tried to draw various polygons
    within it to get the look I wanted. I finally ended up using the 2D "Radial" grid component with the circle and
    then building off the cells and points. This was the only way I was able to generate "rectangles" that were
    relatively sized around the circle without writing an expression. Using the "Distance" and "Larger Than"
    components, I was able to scale the rectangles to be larger the further away they are from the center of the
    circle. I baked the results into Rhino and did some refining to remove overlaps, straighten some lines, remove
    some pieces, and scale in different factors as I tested the print.

    </div>
    <span class="centerCaption">Iterations of the radial shoulder piece</span>

    <br /><br />
    Closing in on the final, I decided I did not like the flat surface I was printing. I drew some curves and lofted
    them onto my print designs, both the rectangles and the radial grid. The curves added a nice dimension that was
    originally missing.

    <br /><br />
    When creating the design that would replace the front part of the collar, I tried reusing the shoulder
    radial pieces, but the scale looked poor. Instead, I drew some circles and then scaled them to a shape based on my
    measurements. I then took a collection of my original rectangle pieces and used "Flow" to move them along
    the curve--I wish I had explored this option sooner! This front piece would be split into 3 pieces for printing,
    and then the back piece would be split into 2 down the middle. I finally had completed the design!

    <p><b>Putting it All Together - Sewing & Post Processing</b>

        The hardest part was attaching the tulle to the elliptical layers on the sleeves. Because I
        laser cut 20 pieces individually to size, I needed to attach each piece perfectly. I placed the black cut sleeve
        fabric on cardboard and stretched the ellipses out, pinning each to hold it firm. I then used Gorilla Spray
        Adhesive to spray it and added each layer one-by-one, starting with the smallest and stacking on top. This built
        the sleeves from the inside out, and they would be flipped over when worn. The adhesive was messy and not
        always strong enough, and I went over layers multiple times and tried re-pinning layers to encourage them to
        dry together. Were I to do this again, I would cut the tulle larger than needed, glue, and then go back and
        remove the excess by hand. In a perfect world, this attachment would be done by sewing machine, yet the laser
        allowed me to cut indescribably thin pieces of fabric that would get caught up in my machine.

    </div>
    <span class="centerCaption">Gluing by lantern light in the frigid garage</span>
    After flattening the sleeves under heavy objects and then ironing them under
    a thin piece of cotton, I used a bit of hot glue to attach any remaining pieces of tulle that had come off. I
    originally planned to hand-sew problem areas, but the spray adhesive had made the fabric too thick to work with.
    <div class="centerFlexImages">

    </div>
    <span class="centerCaption">Carefully ironing</span>
    <br /><br />

    After drying, the sleeves were hand-sewn to the shoulder pieces. The shoulder pieces were hand-sewn to the
    front and back collar pieces. The closure in the back was created by taking extra suiting fabric to bind the raw
    tulle edge and then sewing a hook and eye to it. As the 3D prints on tulle finished, I hand-sewed them together
    trimmed them one edge at a time.
