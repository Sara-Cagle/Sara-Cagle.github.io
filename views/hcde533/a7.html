<H1>A7- Project Proposal - An exploration in digital fabrication in fashion</H1>

<div class="groupedText">
    <p><b>Prompt</b> Create a concept with sketches that requires a collection of fabrication techniques to create.
        Include a contingency plan in case the project falls through. Also include a bill of materials and sourcing
        plan.

    <p><b>Idea & Process</b>
        A wearable work of art designed digitally with Rhino and Grasshopper. This piece of work will be a top garment
        designed to drape over the wearer and connect around the neck. My contingency plan involves creating this
        garment in phases that each add on to eachother, meaning that completing the first phase will ensure a core
        deliverable.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Phase 1</b> Create the parametric draping "sleeves" and neck/shoulder connection point. This will involve 3D
        printing the neck/shoulder connection point and laser cutting fabric that must first be designed in Rhino and
        Grasshopper. The sleeves will connect to the 3D connection point. The 3D printed components will be finished
        using a Dremel kit to smooth and clean edges.<br />
        Timeline:
    <ol>
        <li>
            11/23 to 11/25 - Begin designing in Rhino and Grasshopper the parametric pieces that will be cut into the
            fabric.
        </li>
        <li>11/24 to 11/25 - Design 3D printed connector, begin 3D printing iterations as soon as possible.</li>
        <li>
            11/25 to 11/27 - Continue 3D printing, take designs to laser cutter and first cut butcher paper before
            moving to cut the fabric.
        </li>
        <li>11/26 to 11/28 - Put the garment together and post process pieces for quality.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Phase 2</b> Create the inner core of the garment, a draping collection of fabrics with 3D printed elements
        also designed parametrically in Rhino. This draping core will also connect to the same connection point as Phase
        1.<br />
        Timeline:
    <ol>
        <li>
            11/27 to 11/28 - Using initial parametric designs, design the core of the garment that will be laser cut.
        </li>
        <li>11/28 to 11/30 - Back to the laser cutter for the fabric.</li>
        <li>
            11/28 to 12/1 - Design the 3D printed elements for the core of the garment and print.
        </li>
        <li>12/1 to 12/2 - Put the garment together and post process pieces for quality.</li>
    </ol>

    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Phase 3</b> Design and print additional 3D accents on fabric and sewn into the garment. This phase will be
        more exploratory than the previous phases and will depend on how the garment hangs and looks in real life.
        <br />
        Timeline:
    <ol>
        <li>
            11/28 to 12/4 - Design and print accents.
        </li>
        <li>12/3 to 12/4 - Post process and combination of pieces.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Phase 4</b> Integrate physical computing into the design by using Neopixel LEDs and a pulse monitor combined
        with a small computer chip to provide a further discursive aspect to the garment as lights within the core of
        the garment flash along with the wearer's pulse.
        <br />
        Timeline:
    <ol>
        <li>
            12/2 to 12/4 - Soldering computer chip together, exploring how lights would look on the fabrics.
        </li>
        <li>12/4 to 12/5 - Programming the lights to match the pulse using some older code I have previously written.
        </li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        Reaching Phase 4 will depend on success on the previous phases. On 12/4 and 12/5, I will spend time recording
        demo footage and photos for this portfolio. 12/6 I will share with the class!

    <p><b>Techniques</b>
    <ul>
        <li>
            3D printing - Creating a neck/shoulder piece that can support the top of the garment. 3D elements printed on
            fabric on the core of the garment.
        </li>
        <li>
            Laser cutting - Laser cutting paper and then fabric into their forms to be used on the garment.
        </li>
        <li>
            Grasshopper - Parametrically designing the 3D and laser cut elements. A collection of ellipses and other
            curves.
        </li>
        <li>
            Rhino - Digitally designing the parametric designs and the 3D designs. Will include mirroring, lofting along
            curves, slicing, and more.
        </li>
        <li>
            Working with Stock parts - Using stock parts such as buckles and straps that will impact the design of 3D
            printing such that they can be used together.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sewing - By hand to tack together layers of fabrics. Potentially by machine as well, depending on connection
            tests with the fabric and different adhesives.
        </li>
        <li>
            Physical Computing - A stretch goal of integrating a pulse sensor and LEDs into the garment. This will
            involve soldering and programming.
        </li>
    </ul>
