<div class="groupedText">
    <p><b>Prompt</b> Create a concept with sketches that requires a collection of fabrication techniques to create.
        Include a contingency plan in case the project falls through. Also include a bill of materials and sourcing
        plan.

    <p><b>Inspiration</b>
        I've been a fan of <a href="http://www.anoukwipprecht.nl/gallery">Anouk Wipprecht</a>'s work since I first saw
        her work in 2014 after her collaboration Volswagen in the International Motor Show in 2013. Her work was
        discursive and vaguely functional, leading me into the world of both fashion tech and better understanding of
        "high fashion" as an art form. She She came back to my mind when I took HCDE 539, Physical Computing and
        Prototyping. I learned to use different electronics and solder things such that it could be combined into a
        garment, but I didn't have any further fabrication experience beyond working with fabric.<br />
        On the hunt for other artists using parametric designs in their work, I came across
        <a href="https://www.irisvanherpen.com/">Iris van Herpen</a>, whose work is beautifully parametric and captures
        the human form in non traditional ways. As I dug deeper into her work, I was able to find videos of her use of
        Grasshopper and varioud methods of 3D printing that she used to build her dresses. <br />
        I also learned about the growing world of meta fashion, using VR and AR to achieve fashionable and whimsicle
        looks that allow art to be gravity defining in ways not limited by the real world. For a bit I had been seeing
        content created with <a href="https://www.clo3d.com/en/">Clo 3D</a> software, which is somewhat of a smarter,
        fashion-focused CAD program that enables both designing and rendering for meta fashion as well as preparing
        real-life designs for distributing.<br />
        In HCDE 539, <a href="https://saracagle.webflow.io/work/art-of-walking">I designed a pair of pants</a> that
        would take the wearer's walking as input to light up the pants as the user walked. Now I think it is about time
        the pants had a matching top, or at least a new creation in the same fashion line.

    <p><b>Idea & Process</b>
        A wearable work of art designed digitally with Rhino and Grasshopper. This piece of work will be a top garment
        designed to drape over the wearer and connect around the neck. My contingency plan involves creating this
        garment in phases that each add on to eachother, meaning that completing the first phase will ensure a core
        deliverable.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Phase 1</b> Create the parametric draping "sleeves" and neck/shoulder connection point. This will involve 3D
        printing the neck/shoulder connection point and laser cutting fabric that must first be designed in Rhino and
        Grasshopper. The sleeves will connect to the 3D connection point. The 3D printed components will be finished
        using a Dremel kit to smooth and clean edges.<br />
        Timeline:
    <ol>
        <li>
            11/23 to 11/25 - Begin designing in Rhino and Grasshopper the parametric pieces that will be cut into the
            fabric.
        </li>
        <li>11/24 to 11/25 - Design 3D printed connector, begin 3D printing iterations as soon as possible.</li>
        <li>
            11/25 to 11/27 - Continue 3D printing, take designs to laser cutter and first cut butcher paper before
            moving to cut the fabric.
        </li>
        <li>11/26 to 11/28 - Put the garment together and post process pieces for quality.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Phase 2</b> Create the inner core of the garment, a draping collection of fabrics with 3D printed elements
        also designed parametrically in Rhino. This draping core will also connect to the same connection point as Phase
        1.<br />
        Timeline:
    <ol>
        <li>
            11/27 to 11/28 - Using initial parametric designs, design the core of the garment that will be laser cut.
        </li>
        <li>11/28 to 11/30 - Back to the laser cutter for the fabric.</li>
        <li>
            11/28 to 12/1 - Design the 3D printed elements for the core of the garment and print.
        </li>
        <li>12/1 to 12/2 - Put the garment together and post process pieces for quality.</li>
    </ol>

    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Phase 3</b> Design and print additional 3D accents on fabric and sewn into the garment. This phase will be
        more exploratory than the previous phases and will depend on how the garment hangs and looks in real life.
        <br />
        Timeline:
    <ol>
        <li>
            11/28 to 12/4 - Design and print accents.
        </li>
        <li>12/3 to 12/4 - Post process and combination of pieces.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Phase 4</b> Integrate physical computing into the design by using Neopixel LEDs and a pulse monitor combined
        with a small computer chip to provide a further discursive aspect to the garment as lights within the core of
        the garment flash along with the wearer's pulse.
        <br />
        Timeline:
    <ol>
        <li>
            12/2 to 12/4 - Soldering computer chip together, exploring how lights would look on the fabrics.
        </li>
        <li>12/4 to 12/5 - Programming the lights to match the pulse using some older code I have previously written.
        </li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        Reaching Phase 4 will depend on success on the previous phases. On 12/4 and 12/5, I will spend time recording
        demo footage and photos for this portfolio. 12/6 I will share with the class!

    <p><b>Techniques</b>
    <ul>
        <li>
            3D printing - Creating a neck/shoulder piece that can support the top of the garment. 3D elements printed on
            fabric on the core of the garment.
        </li>
        <li>
            Laser cutting - Laser cutting paper and then fabric into their forms to be used on the garment.
        </li>
        <li>
            Grasshopper - Parametrically designing the 3D and laser cut elements. A collection of ellipses and other
            curves.
        </li>
        <li>
            Rhino - Digitally designing the parametric designs and the 3D designs. Will include mirroring, lofting along
            curves, slicing, and more.
        </li>
        <li>
            Working with Stock parts - Using stock parts such as buckles and straps that will impact the design of 3D
            printing such that they can be used together.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sewing - By hand to tack together layers of fabrics. Potentially by machine as well, depending on connection
            tests with the fabric and different adhesives.
        </li>
        <li>
            Physical Computing - A stretch goal of integrating a pulse sensor and LEDs into the garment. This will
            involve soldering and programming.
        </li>
